# Visual Studio Code Setup

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is an extremely powerful text editor and, with the right extensions,
can offer functionality similar to a full-blown IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ) in a much leaner
and customizable manner.

## Extensions

There are a large number of extensions which I recommend installing, however, your uses may vary and
you may not need all of them. These are categorized and may be installed by executing `./install.sh`
from this folder in your terminal.
