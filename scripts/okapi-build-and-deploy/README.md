# Deprecated

This was used some for local testing of `mod-calendar` and was adapted from the instructions in `folio-sample-modules` to deploy something to Okapi.  It's likely very overcomplicated, only works in certain use cases, and is absolutely not recommended for use.  It's being kept here in case it might provide some helpful commands for other uses.
