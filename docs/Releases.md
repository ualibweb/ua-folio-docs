# How to release a module

If you are at all unsure during this process, or do not have permissions, ask before proceeding;
#devops can be asked about permissions adn Oleksii Petrenko in Slack is a wonderful person to ask if
you have any questions.

For frontend modules, follow
[this guide](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes/blob/master/doc/release-procedure.md#release-procedure).
You should be able to disregard anything about Jenkins.

For backend modules, the "quick summary" on
[this wiki page](https://dev.folio.org/guidelines/release-procedures/) is a good reference.
