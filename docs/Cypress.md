# Cypress Tests

Cypress is a versatile front end testing suite that is made to test anything that runs in the browser. See the full [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) and their usage in [folio-org/stripes-testing](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-testing/tree/master).

At its core, Cypress tests are designed to simplify the process of testing web applications by providing a complete end-to-end testing experience.
There are 2 main uses/test types that you can execute with Cypress:

## End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios from start to finish. 
Cypress allows for automated browsing of applications, interaction with elements (like forms and links), and verification of application behavior.



## Component Tests

Component tests focus on individual components of a web application in isolation.
With Cypress, developers can mount individual components and test their functionality, inputs, outputs, and events. 

For more information on Cypress tests see the full [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress). To run any of these tests, you will need to [install](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app) Cypress.
