**Notes/Clarification/Background/Supporting Links:** Team Bama has rewritten the calendar modules to
better reflect the needs of FOLIO users, including a number of features such as new calendar
formats, improved exception handling, and multi-service point assignments. Due to the size of this
rewrite, we felt it was most appropriate to submit this to the TC as a new module.
