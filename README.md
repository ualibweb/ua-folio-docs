# ua-folio-docs

A centralized source for UA-specific documentation for interacting with the FOLIO project. This will
contain any documentation/scripts that we may use to setup and interact with local FOLIO
environments, documentation for our development process as a whole, and any module-specific
documentation that is not appropriate for inclusion with that module itself.
