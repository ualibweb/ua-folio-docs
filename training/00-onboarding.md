# Onboarding

First, you will need the following accounts:

- `@ua.edu` email address -- temporary credentials for this should have been sent to your crimson
  email once you were hired. If you cannot find it, search for something from "OnBase"
- FOLIO Jira/Confluence account -- sign up at
  [this link](https://issues.folio.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa) using your `@ua.edu` email address
- FOLIO slack -- sign up using your `@ua.edu` email address at
  [this link](https://slack-invitation.folio.org/)
- GitHub account, if you do not have one.

Once you have these accounts, we'll need to grant you access to our repositories and workspaces:

- A current member of the team should make a request in the FOLIO #devops channel to add your GitHub
  account to `folio-org`'s Bama team (note, it is required that a link to the GitHub profile is
  given, to prevent typos)
- In the same #devops channel, a request should also be made to give your Jira user permissions, too
- Steven will need to invite you to the UA libraries Slack and the `ualibweb` GitHub organization

In the FOLIO Slack, the following channels may be of interest:

- **#bama -- our channel**
- **#bama-internal -- team-wide discussions, requires an invite**; be sure to turn notifications on
  for all messages!
- #development -- general development discussion
- #devops -- discussion of anything DevOps, mainly configuration with GitHub and build systems
- #folio-general -- general discussion of the FOLIO project
- #folio-spring-base -- information for the Spring Way backend framework
- #hosted-reference-envs -- discussion and information about the reference environments, such as
  https://folio-snapshot.dev.folio.org/. Very useful when things are down/broken
- #random -- off topic discussion
- #releases -- for announcements of module and project releases
- #stripes -- general chat for the Stripes frontend framework
- #stripes-architecture -- discussion about the high-level architecture and direction of the Stripes
  frontend framework
- #stripes-updates -- announcements for the Stripes frontend framework
- #support -- general place for most simple FOLIO questions
- #tech-council -- for when the technical council decides things
- #ux -- general discussion for user interface design, absolutely great place to discuss design
  choices (choosing where buttons should go, what kind of wording/display layout is most
  appropriate, etc)
